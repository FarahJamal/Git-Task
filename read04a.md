# Dynamic web pages with JavaScript.
### what is JavaScript?
* #####  JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.

### JavaScript Expressions and Operators. 

* JavaScript operators are used to assign values, compare values, perform arithmetic operations, and more.

  
#### 1- JavaScript Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic between variables and/or values.
 * Given that y = 5, the table below explains the arithmetic operators:

|Operator	|Description	|Example	|Result in y	|Result in x|
|------|-----------|--------|----------|----------|
|+	|Addition	|x = y + 2	|y = 5	|x = 7|	
|-	|Subtraction	|x = y - 2|	y = 5	|x = 3|	
|  * |Multiplication	| x = y * 2 |	y = 5	| x = 10|	
|/ |	Division|	x = y / 2|	y = 5|	x = 2.5|	
|%	|Modulus (division remainder)	|x = y % 2|	y = 5	|x = 1|	
|++	|Increment| x = ++y OR x = y++ |	y = 6 OR 	y = 6	|x = 6 OR x = 5	|	               	
|--|	Decrement|	x = --y OR x=y--|	y = 4 OR y=4	|x = 4 OR x=5|

#### 2- JavaScript Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used to assign values to JavaScript variables.
* Given that x = 10 and y = 5, the table below explains the assignment operators:

|Operator|	Example|	Same As|	Result in x|	
|------|-----------|--------|----------|----------|
|=	|x = y|	x = y|	x = 5	|
|+=	|x += y|	x = x + y	|x = 15|	
|-=	|x -= y	|x = x - y	|x = 5	|
|*=	|x *= y	|x = x * y	|x = 50	|
|/=	|x /= y	|x = x / y	|x = 2	|
|%=|	x %= y|	x = x % y	|x = 0|


## Control Flow.
  * #### The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.
  * #### Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.

### Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

1- Conditional Statements Very often when you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions.

2- You can use conditional statements in your code to do this.

3- In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:

  * Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
  * Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
  * Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
  * Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed.


  # Examples.

  #### 1- Assign values to variables and add them together:
```
var x = 5;         // assign the value 5 to x
var y = 2;         // assign the value 2 to y
var z = x + y;     // assign the value 7 to z (5 + 2)
```

#### 2- The assignment operator (=) assigns a value to a variable.(Assignment)
```
var x = 10;
```
#### 3-The addition operator (+) adds numbers:
```
var x = 5;
var y = 2;
var z = x + y;
```
#### 4-The multiplication operator (*) multiplies numbers.

```
var x = 5;
var y = 2;
var z = x * y;
```
